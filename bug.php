This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling.  The comparison `$a == $b` uses loose comparison, meaning PHP will attempt to convert the operands to a common type before comparing. This can lead to unexpected results.

```php
$a = 0;
$b = "0.00";

if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Equal";
} else {
  echo "Not Equal";
}
```

In this example, despite `$a` being an integer and `$b` being a string, the loose comparison considers them equal because PHP converts the string "0.00" to the numerical value 0 before the comparison.
